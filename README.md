# Auditing-Smart-Contracts

Welcome to the `Auditing-Smart-Contracts` repository. This project is dedicated to ensuring the security and reliability of blockchain-based applications by performing comprehensive audits of smart contracts. The primary goal is to identify vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and enhance trust and transparency in decentralized systems.

## Verification and Security

Each modification to this project undergoes a meticulous verification process and subsequent signing. This stringent approach guarantees the authenticity and integrity of our codebase. In case you encounter any modifications that lack appropriate verification, we strongly advise against cloning or utilizing them, as they might harbor malicious code.

## Commented Code

**Please take note:** Our codebase is meticulously documented with comprehensive comments, aimed at providing a clear understanding of the functionality of individual components.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Auditing**: In-depth analysis of Solidity smart contracts to uncover security vulnerabilities and issues. 
- **Best Practices Enforcement**: Ensure adherence to industry best practices and coding standards.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed audit reports with findings, recommendations, and mitigation strategies.
- **Blockchain Compatibility**: Support for auditing contracts on various blockchain platforms (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain).
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regular updates and enhancements to adapt to evolving security threats.

## Getting Started

To explore and interact with the Aave Flash Loan Contract, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Node.js and Hardhat and npm installed in your environment.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Smart Contract Auditing

In this project, we will be covering the 5 most common pitfalls that auditors find in their audits:
  - Missing input or precondition checks.
  - Phishing vulnerabilities with transactions origin.
  - Incorrect calculation of output token amount.
  - Timestamp manipulation.
  - Block gas limit vulnerabilities.

**Will be updated soon**

## Pitfalls Test

To Run a pitfalls test:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```
