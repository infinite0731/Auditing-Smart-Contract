# Auditing-Smart-Contracts

Welcome to the `Auditing-Smart-Contracts` repository. This project is dedicated to ensuring the security and reliability of blockchain-based applications by performing comprehensive audits of smart contracts. The primary goal is to identify vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and enhance trust and transparency in decentralized systems.

## Verification and Security

Each modification to this project undergoes a meticulous verification process and subsequent signing. This stringent approach guarantees the authenticity and integrity of our codebase. In case you encounter any modifications that lack appropriate verification, we strongly advise against cloning or utilizing them, as they might harbor malicious code.

## Commented Code

**Please take note:** Our codebase is meticulously documented with comprehensive comments, aimed at providing a clear understanding of the functionality of individual components.

## Getting Started

To explore and interact with our `Auditing-Smart-Contracts` project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Innovation-Web-3-0-Blockchain/Auditing-Smart-Contracts.git
    ```

2. Ensure you have `node.js` and `npm` installed in your environment.

3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Scenario

In this scenario, a group of developers submitted the `VulnerableLenderPool.sol` contract to an auditing firm for evaluation. The auditing firm conducted a thorough review and produced a comprehensive report highlighting all the vulnerabilities present in the `VulnerableLenderPool.sol` contract. Subsequently, the identified vulnerabilities were addressed and patched in an enhanced version of the contract, known as `SecureLenderPool.sol`. This improved contract is designed to eliminate the security weaknesses and enhance the overall security of the lending pool.

## Features

### Smart Contracts Auditing

In-depth analysis of Solidity smart contracts to uncover security vulnerabilities and issues. In this project, we will be covering the 5 most common pitfalls that auditors find in their audits:

  - Missing input or precondition checks.
  - Phishing vulnerabilities with transactions origin.
  - Incorrect calculation of output token amount.
  - Timestamp manipulation.
  - Block gas limit vulnerabilities.

For a more comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities and the possible actions that a malicious actor can take, please refer to our [Auditing Project Documentations](./Auditing-Project-Documentations/AUDITREPORT.md).

### Smart Contracts Analysis Tools

Smart Contract analysis tools are designed to assist developers, auditors, and blockchain enthusiasts in comprehensively examining and evaluating the code and behavior of smart contracts. Here are some key objectives and use cases of such tools:

  - Security Assessment
  - Extensibility
  - Integration
  - Comprehensive Reports
  - Solidity Compatibility
  - Open Source

Please refer to our [Auditing Project Documentations](./Auditing-Project-Documentations/ANALYSISTOOLS.md) for detailed guidance on how to utilize these tools and integrate them into your projects.
